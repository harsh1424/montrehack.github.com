# MontreHack website
Quickly understand how-to setup.

## Local testing

First, setup your stuff. We are following github's recommandations: <https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/>. Make sure you have `bundle` and that you ran `bundle install` inside the repo.

* To run the dev server:

        $ bundle exec jekyll serve

* View the site: <http://localhost:4000/>

## Keeping current with github

If github requires new version of stuff or you get some sort of server error
just run:

	bundle update

Then retry the local testing.
